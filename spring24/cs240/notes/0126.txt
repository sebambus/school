ARCHITECTURE
--Windows--
Kernel Mode Processes:
User Mode Processes:
 - Special System
 - Service
 - Environment Subsystems
  - Win32: standard windows environment
  - POSIX: added from regulation pressure
 - Applications

--Unix--
Hardware
Kernel Level:
 - PCS
  - Scheduler
  - Memory Management
  - Interprocess communication
 - File Subsystem: popularized by unix
 - Device Drivers: treats devices like files stored in /dev
  - block: buffered by a cache (starts with b)
  - character: one byte at a time (starts with c)

PROCESSES
Process: an instance of a program running on a computer
Characterized by the execution of an a.out, a state, and system instructions/context

Elements:
 - ID (Unix: PID)
 - State
 - Priority
 - PC (program counter)
 - Pointers
 - Context
 - I/O status
 - Accounting (duration, etc.)

PCB (Process Control Block)
Stores all elements
Represents the full process

2-State Model
Toggles between running/not running
Runs a queue of processes - each item is moved to the back of the queue at timeout/io/etc.
