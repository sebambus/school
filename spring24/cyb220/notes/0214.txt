ANNOUNCEMENTS
Assignment #2 this friday
No lab on friday, discussing presentation #1, will be a group project
No class Monday

INTEGER ERRORS
Conversions can lead loss of data
Widening
 - convert from narrow type to a wider type
 - if source is unsigned, propagates 0s
 - if source is signed, propagates sign bit
Narrowing
 - always truncates

When do conversions happen
 - simple conversion
  - type cast
  - assignment
  - funciton call
  - fucntion return
 - integer promotions
 - standard arithmatic conversions

Errors
 - integer overflow/underflow
 - type conversion

Integer Promotion
smaller data types are promoted to a larger data type when operations are performed on them
integer converions rank
 ^ long long int
 ^ long int
 ^ int
 ^ short \
 ^ char   will be promoted
 ^ bool  /
requesites
 - only works on integers
 - only works on types smaller than int

Arithmetic converion
 - +,-,*,/,%,...
 - <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
 - &,^,|
 - ? operator
converts two operand to have the same type in order to combine them
rules
 1 floating points take precedence
  - double <= float <= int
 2 apply integer promotion
 3 same signs are promoted to the larger type
 4 unsigned >= signed, the signed is promoted then converted to unsigned
 5 unsigned < signed, if lossless narrowing is possible, then narrow signed integer to unsigned
 6 otherwise narrow unsigned and cause LOSS
