INPUT STREAM FUNCTIONS
 - gets()
char* gets(char* str)
reads until '\n' or EOF and stores them in str
DANGEROUS: will continue beyond the end of the buffer, causing memory overwrite

 - fgets()
char* fgets(char* str, int num, FILE* stream)
reads in num-1 chars, stores them in str, and appends a null terminator

 - getchar()
char getchar(void)
reads a single char from an input stream
