META CHARS
Metadata:
accompanying data
 - NUL terminator
 - EOL chars
 - / or . in paths
 - @ in email addresses

Path Meta Chars
very common vulnerabilities
hierarchy delimiter
 - / in UNIX
 - \ in Windows

paths can be represented as strings with an absolute path
ex.
  C:\\WINDOWS\system32\calc.exe
can also be accessed with
  C:\\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\..\calc.exe

The Dot-Dot-Slash Attack
passing ../ repeatedly to gain access to parent directories allowing access outside the subdirectory
ex.
  open(FH, "</users/profiles/$username");
   - vulnerable to ../ inputs

Shell Meta Chars
extenstive list of meta chars
  ; | & < > ` etc.

SQL Queries
SQL is a language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMSs)
incorrect handling can be very dangerous, SQL injection
example SQL code:
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Williams';
   - returns all records with 'Williams' in name
  QUERY = "SELECT * FROM trans WHERE acct = '" + acctNum + "';
    can be attacked with
  QUERY = "SELECT * FROM trans WHERE acct = '' OR '1' = '1';

Web App Example
SELECT * FROM logintable WHERE user='" . $username . "' and pass='" . $password . "'
malicious input:
  $username = bob' OR user<>'bob
  $password = bob' OR user<>'bob
result:
  SELECT * FROM logintable WHERE user='bob' OR user<>'bob' AND pass='bob' OR pass<>'bob'

FILTERING
important for anything with metachars
options:
 - reject an apparent attack
 - strip dangerous chars
 - encode chars as friendly chars

Rejection
relatively safe, but unfriendly

Stripping
Filters require care
Very flexible, more friendly

types of filters
 - blacklist
 - whitelist

Encode
filters require more care
most friendly, creates and arms race
generally adds escapes to the strings
other endcodings
 - URL encoding
 - HTML/XML encoding
