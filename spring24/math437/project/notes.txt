METHODS
 - NODE to approximate species dynamics
 - BNGM to fit NODEs in seconds
 - Ecological interactions are gleened from the effects of species density on dynamics

 NEURAL ORDIANRY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
 Benefits
  - non-parametric, so not subject to incorrect specifications
  - dynamical, meaning it is continuous and can have emergent behavior that can simulate lag effects
 Example SLP NODE
  y' = tanh(b1 + W1(S(b2 + W2y)))
  where W1 and W2 are weight matrices
	b1 and b2 are bias vectors
	S(y) is the sigmoid function
  tanh and S can be replaced by other functions with similar properties
  y' can be replaced with y'/y to approimate per capita growth rate instead of general growth rate
