Character Notes
	Achilles tends to flip on a dime. One moment he’s responsibly looking after his camp, the next he’s sulking away from the front. One moment he’s adamantly antimilitant, the next he’s eager to fight to the point of self-neglect. He’s sort of childish in that manner, as he blindly follows where his emotions take him. I can imagine in a modern courtroom, he’d be very easy for lawyers to goad and play, as his pride and passion consistently get the best of him.  
	Another trend is that Achilles highly values societal norms. He wants to see the camp running orderly, the wealth distributed customarily, and he wants to see Agamemnon act like a leader is supposed to. He strikes me as very “holier-than-thou". I think deep down what he wants to see is a result that fits into his idea of how society should run, regardless of the material outcome. That said, he is massively offended by Agamemnon, so I doubt he will be satisfied by any outcome. 
	Achilles is sort of a loose cannon that has to be carefully managed by the other characters. Both Patroklos and his mother, Thetis, seem to be calming influences for Achilles, and would be most likely to be able to broker a deal from his end. His ego is incredibly fragile currently, however, so anyone who is acting in a position of authority, especially if it’s one beyond their paygrade, is likely to really antagonize him.
