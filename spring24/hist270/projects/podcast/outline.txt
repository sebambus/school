 Military Effects
  rome developed a navy for the first time and began really studying tactics and strategy in response to hannibal
 Societal Effects
  as rome's military venture moved decisively away from italy, the romans were able to focus more on societal injustice than imminent military danger
5 Comparing Effects
 the wars mirror each other
  three wars: set up, main war, then a final subjecation
  unfamiliar tactics that cause major military reform
  a change in scale of the empire
  social development as the empire became richer and stronger on the backs of the lower classes
 the wars were unique
  following expeditions were far from home and had little direct effect on citizens
  introduction of military pay changed the landscape of how military events affected societal reform
  they were the formative wars for the military, creating the most innovation in tactics and structure
Conclusion
 reiterate points from introduction and comparison of effects
 wrap up speaking
