Story
Zeus wants to bang Europa. Her family is protective, so Zeus disguises himself as a bull and kidnaps her. He takes her to Crete, and has at least one kid, named Minos. Three brothers are shipped off to find Europa. Minos and his two brothers fight over a boy. The boy dies, but Minos wins. Eventually, the king of Crete dies, and Minos needs to make a claim for the throne. He prays for a bull as a party trick. Posiedon provides, expecting sacrifice. Minos sacrifices a different bull, and Posiedon drives the bull wild and makes Pasiphae fall in lust with the bull. Daedelus is hiding in Crete at this time and builds a bull exoskeleton for Pasiphae. She bangs the bull and has a kid: the Minotaur. Minos is pissed and forces Daedelus to build a labyrinth to keep the Minotaur in. Adogegus, one of the brothers, participates in the Olympics (not the olympics), and gets assasinated. Minos gets pissed again, and makes Athens give him 7 boys and 7 girls to feed to the Minotaur. Aegeus gets an oracle, and his buddy decides that means he needs to bang his daughter. She has a son who is raised without knowing his dad until his teenage years. Theseus travels to Athens, and has adventurers. Aegeus is told Theseus is plotting against him, and tries to kill him by bull, and then poison. Upon discovering Theseus is his son, Aegeus cancels his plot and makes up. Theseus volunteers to be fed to the Minotaur. Aegeus asks Theseus to use white sails if he survives. Minos's daughter thinks Theseus is hot, and she wants to save him. She coerces Daedalus to give her the hint to the maze, which is a ball of thread. Theseus sacrifices the Minotaur to Posiedon, and fulfills the old oath. Theseus returns without changing his sails, and Aegeus kills himself. Theseus's throne is challenged by his 50 cousins, who he kills and is exiled for a year. He marries Ariadne's little sister, who tries to bang his son, Hippolytus. Hippolytus refuses, because his is chaste for Artemis. Paedra claims she was raped by Hippolytus, and Theseus prays for him to be killed by Poseidon. When Theseus discovers the truth, Paedra kills herself to avoid punishment.
